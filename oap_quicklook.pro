PRO OAP_QUICKLOOK
;User input is needed for the INPUT_TYPE, file-directory and DELETE_FILE
;would you like to input custom data or read data from a .CSV file
;IF A CSV FILE IS BEING USED PLEASE HAVE THE ORDER OF THE COLLUMS AS FOLLOWS
;PROC_FILE, DIMG_FILE, DATE, START_TIME_SEC, END_TIME_SEC, Display_particles_touching_edge, Display_rejected_particles, minD, maxD, OUTPUT_FILE_PATH, OUTPUT_FILE_TYPE(pdf or png), READ_ROW(SKIP OR RUN)
;if you are doing a custom input, please input your variables into the OAP_QUICKLOOK_GETSETUP function
INPUT_TYPE='file' ; the two options for this varaible are 'file' or 'custom'. If file is selected FILE you will be promptED to pic a .csv file
;File_directory is where the diolg box in OAP_QUICKLOOK_GETSETUP should be looking. this can be a broad search or narrow. 
;It can be left blank if the directory is not know or if INPUT_TYPE= 'custom' 
file_directory='/home/medwar29/Desktop/'
;!!!!!!!!
;If the DELETE_FILE feature is on, and the output_file_final matches an existing file then the file will be deleted to allow for a new one
;The program will pause before a file is deleted and show a message that a file is about to be deleted.
;If you have 'OFF' selected and a file with a matching name exist then the program will show a message and then change the file name to include (#) at the end of the file name
;OFF=no files will be deleted, ON=files will be deleted
DELETE_FILE= 'OFF'

STOP_VARIABLE='OFF' ;the stop varaible tells us if there are no more particles in a possible time frame. The default is off, if it is turn to on then the program will act accordingly
LINE_READ_VARIABLE='run' ;this is the default if we want to run through a custom entry. 
page=1 ;this is the page counter for the pdf
